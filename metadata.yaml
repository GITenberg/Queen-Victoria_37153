description: 'In this book, we see Victoria as a strong-willed child with a famous
  temper, as the 18-year-old girl queen, as a monarch, wife, mother and widow. Lytton
  Strachey''s acclaimed portrayal of Queen Victoria revolutionised the art of biography
  by using elements of romantic fiction and melodrama to create a warm, humorous and
  very human portrait of this iconic figure.  Equally fascinating are the depictions
  of her relationships: with her governess "precious Lehzen", with Peel, Gladstone
  and Disraeli, with her beloved Albert and, in later life, her legendary devotion
  to her Highland servant John Brown, all of which show a different side of the staid,
  pious image that is so often attached to her. Awarded the James Tait Black Memorial
  Prize, Strachey''s classic biography remains one of the best and most readable accounts
  of the Queen who defined an era.'
